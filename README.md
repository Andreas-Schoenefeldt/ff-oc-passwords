#Firefox + ownCloud Passwords
#### 2016, Andreas Egli

##Summary
A Firefox add-on to access passwords stored in an ownCloud.
Requires the [ownCloud Passwords](https://github.com/fcturner/passwords) app.

##Security
All data exchange with the ownCloud instance is done via the API.
**It is strongly recommended to only use SSL encrypted connections, otherwise all passwords will be transmitted in cleartext!**
The ownCloud username and password are stored locally in the Firefox password manager.
**It is strongly recommended to set a master password in Firefox, otherwise all passwords will be accessible for anyone with access to your computer!**
